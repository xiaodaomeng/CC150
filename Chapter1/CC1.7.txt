method 1: two boolean array [M] [N] to tag the row and col 0, before access the value, check the flag.
time O(N^2),extra space O(M+N)

step 1: check first row and col if 0 exist, and tag one flag
step 2: loop inner matrix, and tag first row and col
step 3: set to 0 based on first col and row status
