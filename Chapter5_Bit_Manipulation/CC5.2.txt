binary represent a double number
0.101 = 1*(1/2^1)+0*(1/2^2)+1*(1/2^3)=5/8
decimal to binary: 
integer: divide by 2 and get remainder
float: multiply by 2 and compare with 1

method 1: follow the math rule, string to represent result
while(num>0)
double r=num*2;
if r>=1, string.push(1), then num = r-1;
else string.push(0), num = r;

method 2: compare 1, 1/2^1, 1/2^2,1/2^3...for each loop
if num>series, push(1),num-series
else push(0)
