method 1: 
first loop(from 1 to true length) to count how many spaces within the true length of the string, and calculate the new length.
second loop (from true length to 1), backward. if meet ' ', write '0','2','%' into the end of string with newlength index, if meet char, copy it. update newlength based on the operation
time O(2N)
space O(1)
