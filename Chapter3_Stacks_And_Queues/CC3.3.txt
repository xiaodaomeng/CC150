method 1:
stack array to record the stacks, when the stk.size()==capacity in push stage, create new stack and then push into stack array.
push() and pop() are applied in the last array
push() need to check the last stk.size()==capacity
pop() need to delete the last stack when it is empty after pop()

Follow up: popAt(int index)
leftshift recursive call if pop from the middle stk, trivial
