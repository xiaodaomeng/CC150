1. every positive integer can be decomposed into a product of primes
2. greatest common divisor of x and y:
   gcd(x,y)=2^min(j0,k0)*3^min(j1,k1)*...
3. least common multiple of x and y: 
   lcm(x,y)=2^max(j0,k0)*3^max(j1,k1)*...
   gcd*lcm=xy
4. generate primes leetcode_extend
5. Probability
   P(A and B)=P(B given A)P(A)
   P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A and B)
