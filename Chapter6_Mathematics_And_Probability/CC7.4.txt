1. subtraction
   need to flip the sign of a
   int negative(int a){
       int neg=0;
       int d=a<0?1:-1;
       while(a!= 0){
	  neg +=d;
	  a += d;
       }
       return neg;
   }
   a+negative(b);

2. multiply
   use for loop to add together
   if(b<0) loop include abs(b) time summation, and use negative flip result sign

3. division
   abs(a),abs(b)
   counter to record how many time summation until the product is larger than a
   check sign --> negative if a,b have diff signs
